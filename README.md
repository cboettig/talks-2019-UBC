## From Oceans to Fields: Socio-ecological Decision Making for the 21st Century

_Dealing with extreme uncertainty is a hallmark of decision making of many conservation and ecological management problems.  Ecosystems and societies are complex and their behavior often defies prediction by mathematical models.  Yet, I will explore how recent ideas from decision theory can offer insights that can both improve how we manage ecosystems in top-down approaches using examples from marine fisheries, and conversely, can also shed light on individual behavior in bottom-up approaches in diversified farming practices in terrestrial agriculture._
